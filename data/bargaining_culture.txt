[Cultural Context: Indian Sabzi Mandi / Fruit & Vegetable Shop Bargaining]
- This is a sabzi mandi (vegetable market) and fruit shop. The vendor sells ONLY fruits and vegetables -- no silk, no brass, no handicrafts.
- Vegetable vendors in Indian street markets expect bargaining on every transaction.
- The first quoted price is ALWAYS 2-4x the actual selling price. This is not dishonesty -- it is the game.
- A vendor who sells at first-ask loses respect from neighboring vendors. Reputation matters more than one sale.
- Local customers ("pukka grahak") get better rates than outsiders. Building rapport unlocks discounts.
- The vendor will act offended at low offers -- this is theater, not genuine anger. Phrases like "Itne mein toh mera khana bhi nahi niklega" (I can't even eat at that price) are standard.
- Walking away is the nuclear option. 8 out of 10 times, the vendor will call you back with a lower price.
- Buying in bulk (2kg+) is a legitimate reason for discount. Vendors respect volume buyers.
- Morning customers often get slight discounts ("bohni" -- first sale of the day is considered auspicious).
- Touching/squeezing vegetables and fruits before buying is expected. If the vendor stops you, the produce may not be fresh.
- Final price is usually 40-60% of the first quoted price for a skilled bargainer.
- Never insult the merchandise or the vendor. Criticism should be respectful and factual, not emotional.
- The concept of "last price" has cultural meaning. When the vendor says "last price," they usually still have 10-15% margin left.
- Silence after a counter-offer is powerful. The vendor will fill the silence with concessions.

[Cultural Context: Sabzi Mandi Shopping Dynamics]
- Sabzi mandi vendors arrange their freshest produce at the front and older stock at the back.
- Customers who look knowledgeable (checking quality, asking about freshness) get quoted lower prices.
- Perishables like tomatoes, spinach, and coriander have the most room for bargaining in the evening.
- Fruit vendors are generally firmer on pricing than vegetable vendors because fruits have higher margins.
- Premium fruits like Alphonso mango, pomegranate, and imported apples have less negotiation room.
- "Tol ke do" (weigh it for me) is essential -- some vendors shortchange on weight by distracting you with conversation.
- Always check the bottom of bags or baskets -- vendors sometimes layer old produce under fresh ones.
- Seasonal awareness is KEY. Knowing what's in season gives you pricing power. Off-season produce is ALWAYS overpriced.
- Free extras like dhaniya (coriander) and hari mirch (green chili) are customary with purchases over ₹100-200.
- Comparing prices from nearby stalls is expected: "Saamne wala ₹40 mein de raha hai" (the stall across is selling at ₹40).

[Vendor Psychology -- Sabzi Wala / Fruit Seller]
- Pride: A sabzi wala who has been in the market for years knows his produce deeply. Compliment the freshness and quality.
- Anchoring: The vendor's first price sets the psychological ceiling. A smart buyer ignores it entirely and counters at 25-30%.
- Emotional leverage: "Bhaiya, roz ayenge" (I'll come daily) signals long-term business -- vendors value repeat customers over one-time profit.
- The "chillar nahi hai" trick: Claiming no change for large notes to round up the price. Common tactic. Carry small cash (₹10, ₹20, ₹50 notes).
- Bundle deals: "Ye tamatar ke saath dhaniya free dedo" (throw in coriander for free with tomatoes) is standard and expected.
- Weight manipulation: Some vendors keep their thumb on the scale. Watch the weighing carefully. "Bhaiya theek se tolo" (weigh properly) is a polite check.
- Quality mix: Vendors bag fresh produce on top with old stock underneath. Always ask "Bhaiya achhi wali dena" (give good quality ones).
- The sob story: "Aaj kuch bikka nahi" (nothing sold today) may or may not be true. It's a sympathy tactic for higher price acceptance.
- Time-of-day strategy: Morning = freshest produce, highest prices. Evening = discounted prices to clear perishable stock.
- Relationship building: A vendor who knows your name and preferences will prioritize fresh stock for you and give honest pricing.

[Vendor Psychology -- Mood and Happiness]
- A happy vendor (happiness_score > 60) is more flexible on price, offers free extras (dhaniya, mirch), and engages warmly.
- A neutral vendor (40-60) plays it safe -- standard negotiation, no extras, no concessions without reason.
- An annoyed vendor (happiness_score < 40) becomes stubborn, quotes higher, may dismiss the buyer or give poor quality produce.
- NEVER push a vendor below happiness 20 -- they will refuse to sell entirely or give you the worst stock.
- Complimenting the vendor's produce freshness or shop arrangement ALWAYS raises happiness by 5-10 points.
- Low-balling (offering less than 25% of quoted price) drops happiness by 15-20 points instantly.
- Walking away drops happiness 10-15 points but is the strongest price lever if the vendor calls you back.
- Buying multiple items (mixed vegetables + fruits) raises happiness 10-15 points -- vendors love volume and variety orders.
- Asking for free dhaniya/mirch without buying enough drops happiness 5-10 points -- it signals cheapness.
- Saying "Bhaiya aaj bohot taaza lag raha hai sab" (everything looks very fresh today) is the single best happiness booster.

[Negotiation State Machine -- Rules]
- GREETING: The opening phase. Greet the vendor warmly. Ask about their day. Compliment the produce display. Do NOT ask price immediately -- it signals urgency.
- INQUIRY: The vendor shows items, explains freshness and quality. The buyer asks about seasonal availability, which batch came today, and what's freshest. STILL no price talk ideal.
- BARGAINING: Price negotiation begins. The vendor quotes high, buyer counters low. Multiple rounds of back-and-forth happen here. Buyer references nearby stall prices.
- COUNTER: The final showdown. The buyer threatens to walk away. The vendor makes their best offer. One side must yield. Buyer may ask for free extras to sweeten deal.
- DEAL_CLOSED: Agreement reached. The vendor weighs and bags the produce. Buyer pays. Both sides ideally leave satisfied.
- A skilled negotiation moves through ALL five states. Jumping from GREETING to DEAL_CLOSED means the buyer overpaid.
- If the buyer is TOO aggressive in BARGAINING, the vendor may "reset" back to INQUIRY by changing the subject to quality: "Bhaiya pehle dekh toh lo kitna taaza hai" (first see how fresh it is).

[Payment and Closing Customs]
- Cash payments earn 2-5% discount because vendors avoid digital transaction fees and tax reporting.
- "Cash mein de raha hoon" (I'm paying in cash) is a legitimate discount lever.
- UPI/PhonePe is increasingly accepted but vendors may round up: ₹147 becomes ₹150 on UPI.
- Festival seasons (Diwali, Holi, Navratri) increase vegetable demand -- prices rise but "shubh" (auspicious) deals exist.
- After closing a deal, saying "Shukriya bhaiya, phir ayenge" (Thanks brother, I'll come again) builds goodwill for next time.
- Vendors remember faces. Being rude in one stall can spread word to neighboring stalls in the mandi.
- Regulars get the best deals: fresh stock kept aside, honest weights, free extras, and advance information on price drops.

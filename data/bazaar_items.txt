[Item: Tomato (Tamatar)]
Wholesale Price: ₹20-30/kg (mandi rate, seasonal)
Fair Retail Price: ₹40-60/kg (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹100-150/kg (first quote to outsiders)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹35/kg (below this, vendor loses money)
Quality Check: Firm and bright red = fresh. Soft or wrinkled = old stock. Smell should be earthy, not sour.
Bargaining Tip: Tomatoes are perishable -- vendors sell cheaper in the evening to avoid waste. Morning prices are higher.
Good Opening Bid: ₹30-40/kg. Vendor will settle at ₹40-60 for fresh stock.
Bulk Discount: Buy 2kg+ and ask "Bhaiya 2 kilo le raha hoon, thoda kam karo" for 10-15% off.
Seasonal Note: Summer prices are lowest (peak harvest). Winter prices rise 2x. Monsoon prices are highest due to crop damage.

[Item: Onion (Pyaaz)]
Wholesale Price: ₹15-25/kg (mandi rate)
Fair Retail Price: ₹30-50/kg (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹80-120/kg (first quote to outsiders)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹25/kg (below this, vendor loses money)
Quality Check: Dry outer skin = good storage. Soft spots or green shoots = old stock going bad. Should feel heavy and solid.
Bargaining Tip: Onion prices swing wildly with politics and monsoon. If prices are high citywide, don't push too hard -- the vendor is also hurting.
Good Opening Bid: ₹20-30/kg. Vendor will settle at ₹30-50 for good quality.
Bulk Discount: Buy 5kg+ and ask "Bhaiya 5 kilo le raha hoon, sab mila ke kitna hoga?" for 15-20% off.
Seasonal Note: Prices spike Sept-Nov (pre-harvest gap). Cheapest in Dec-Feb (peak harvest).

[Item: Potato (Aloo)]
Wholesale Price: ₹15-20/kg (mandi rate)
Fair Retail Price: ₹25-40/kg (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹60-100/kg (first quote to outsiders)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹20/kg (below this, not worth selling)
Quality Check: No green spots (green = solanine = bitter and mildly toxic). Firm skin, no sprouts. Medium size preferred for cooking.
Bargaining Tip: Potatoes have thin margins -- vendors won't drop much. Better to bundle with other items for combo discount.
Good Opening Bid: ₹15-25/kg. Vendor will settle at ₹25-35 for fresh stock.
Bulk Discount: Buy 3kg+ for ₹5-10/kg off. Potatoes store well so bulk buying makes sense.
Seasonal Note: Relatively stable year-round. Slight price rise in monsoon due to transport issues.

[Item: Watermelon (Tarbooz)]
Wholesale Price: ₹8-12/kg (summer season)
Fair Retail Price: ₹15-25/kg (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹40-60/kg (first quote to outsiders, per piece pricing is common)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹12/kg (below this, vendor loses money)
Quality Check: Knock on it -- hollow deep sound = ripe and sweet. Look for the yellow spot on the bottom (ground spot) where it sat in the field. No spot = picked too early. Heavier = more water = juicier.
Bargaining Tip: Watermelon vendors often sell per piece (₹60-100 each). Ask for per-kg rate -- it's always cheaper. "Bhaiya tol ke do" (weigh it) forces fair pricing.
Good Opening Bid: ₹10-15/kg or ₹40-50 per piece. Vendor settles at ₹15-25/kg.
Seasonal Note: Available March-July only. Peak cheapest in May-June. Out of season = imported and expensive.
Freshness Test: If the vendor lets you taste a slice before buying, the watermelon is likely good. Refusing = risky purchase.

[Item: Mango (Aam)]
Wholesale Price: ₹40-80/kg (varies wildly by variety)
Fair Retail Price: ₹80-150/kg (Alphonso/Hapus is premium)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹200-400/kg (first quote for Alphonso)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹60/kg (below this, vendor loses money on premium varieties)
Quality Check: Squeeze gently -- slight give = ripe. Hard = raw. Too soft = overripe. Alphonso has distinct sweet aroma at the stem. No wrinkles near the stem.
Bargaining Tip: Know your varieties! Alphonso (Hapus) is the king. Dasheri, Langra, Chausa are excellent but cheaper. Vendors often sell Dasheri as Alphonso -- learn the difference.
Good Opening Bid: ₹60-80/kg for Dasheri/Langra. ₹100-120/kg for genuine Alphonso.
Bulk Discount: Buy a full "peti" (crate, ~10-12 dozen) for wholesale rates. "Ek peti de do" gets 30-40% off per-kg rate.
Seasonal Note: Available April-July only. Alphonso season is shorter (April-June). Late season mangoes are cheaper but less sweet.
Cultural Note: Mango is the national fruit of India. Complimenting the mango variety raises vendor happiness significantly.

[Item: Banana (Kela)]
Wholesale Price: ₹20-30/dozen (mandi rate)
Fair Retail Price: ₹40-60/dozen (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹80-120/dozen (first quote to outsiders)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹30/dozen (below this, not worth selling)
Quality Check: Yellow with small brown spots = perfectly ripe and sweet. All green = will take 2-3 days to ripen. Black patches = overripe.
Bargaining Tip: Bananas are sold per dozen, not per kg. Margins are thin so vendors won't drop much. Buy 2 dozen for a combo deal.
Good Opening Bid: ₹30-40/dozen. Vendor will settle at ₹40-50 for good ripe ones.
Seasonal Note: Available year-round. Prices stable. South Indian varieties (Elaichi kela) are premium.

[Item: Lemon (Nimbu)]

Fair Retail Price: ₹120-200/kg or ₹5-10 per piece
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹15-20 per piece
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹100/kg
Quality Check: Bright yellow-green = fresh. Dull or brownish = old. Should feel firm and heavy for size. Thin-skinned lemons are juicier.
Bargaining Tip: Often sold per piece at inflated rates. Ask "Bhaiya kilo mein do" (give by the kilo) for much better value.
Good Opening Bid: ₹80-100/kg. Vendor settles at ₹100-150.
Seasonal Note: Cheapest in summer (June-Aug). Prices spike in winter and monsoon (₹200-300/kg).

[Item: Green Chili (Hari Mirch)]
Wholesale Price: ₹30-50/kg (mandi rate)
Fair Retail Price: ₹60-100/kg (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹150-200/kg (first quote to outsiders)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹50/kg
Quality Check: Bright green and firm = fresh. Wrinkled or soft = old. Snap one -- should break crisply with seeds visible. Smell should be sharp and pungent.
Bargaining Tip: Green chilies are bought in small quantities (100g-250g). Vendors often give them free as a bonus with bigger purchases. "Bhaiya thodi mirch daal do" (throw in some chilies) works with ₹200+ orders.
Good Opening Bid: ₹40-60/kg. Vendor settles at ₹60-80.
Bundle Deal: Buy with other vegs and ask for free mirch and dhaniya (coriander) on top.

[Item: Coriander (Dhaniya)]
Wholesale Price: ₹20-40/bunch
Fair Retail Price: ₹10-20/bunch (small) or ₹30-50/bunch (large)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹30-50/bunch
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹10/bunch
Quality Check: Bright green leaves, no yellowing. Stems should be firm not wilted. Strong fresh aroma.
Bargaining Tip: Coriander is often given FREE with vegetable purchases over ₹100-200. "Bhaiya dhaniya daal do" is standard and expected. If vendor charges for it, they're being stingy.
Cultural Note: Free dhaniya is a sign of a good vendor-customer relationship. A vendor who refuses free dhaniya is likely overcharging on everything else.

[Item: Cauliflower (Phool Gobhi)]
Wholesale Price: ₹20-30/piece (mandi rate)
Fair Retail Price: ₹30-60/piece (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹80-120/piece (first quote to outsiders)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹25/piece
Quality Check: Tight white florets = fresh. Yellow spots or loose florets = old. Check for worms by looking between florets. Leaves should be green and crisp, not wilted.
Bargaining Tip: Sold per piece, not per kg usually. Ask "Bhaiya tol ke do" (weigh it) for fair pricing -- some pieces are 500g, some are 1.5kg.
Good Opening Bid: ₹20-30/piece for medium. ₹40-50 for large. Vendor settles at ₹30-50.
Seasonal Note: Cheapest in winter (Nov-Feb). Summer prices double.

[Item: Lady Finger (Bhindi / Okra)]
Wholesale Price: ₹30-40/kg (mandi rate)
Fair Retail Price: ₹50-80/kg (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹100-150/kg (first quote to outsiders)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹40/kg
Quality Check: Snap the tip -- should break crisply. If it bends, it's old and fibrous. Bright green, no dark spots. Smaller bhindi (2-3 inches) are more tender than large ones.
Bargaining Tip: Quality varies hugely. Insist on checking before the vendor bags them. "Bhaiya achhi wali dena" (give the good ones) prevents them from mixing old stock.
Good Opening Bid: ₹35-50/kg. Vendor settles at ₹50-70.
Seasonal Note: Summer vegetable. Cheapest June-Sept. Winter prices are 2x.

[Item: Spinach (Palak)]
Wholesale Price: ₹10-15/bunch
Fair Retail Price: ₹20-30/bunch (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹40-60/bunch
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹15/bunch
Quality Check: Dark green, large leaves = good. Yellowing = old. No slime on leaves. Roots should look freshly cut.
Bargaining Tip: Leafy greens are very low-margin. Buy 3-4 bunches to negotiate a combo rate. "Bhaiya 3 bunch de do, kitne mein doge?" gets 20-30% off.
Good Opening Bid: ₹10-15/bunch. Vendor settles at ₹15-25.
Bundle Deal: Often bundled with methi (fenugreek) and bathua for a "saag combo." 3 bunches for ₹40-50 is a standard deal.

[Item: Apple (Seb)]
Wholesale Price: ₹60-80/kg (Himachali/Kashmiri)
Fair Retail Price: ₹80-120/kg (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹150-250/kg (first quote to outsiders)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹70/kg
Quality Check: Firm, no soft spots or bruises. Red doesn't always mean sweet -- ask which variety is sweetest. Shimla apples are seasonal and premium. Imported apples (Washington) are waxed -- rub and check.
Bargaining Tip: Apples are not heavily bargained but you can negotiate on bulk. Buy 3-5 kg for a better rate. "Bhaiya 3 kilo le raha hoon, ₹80 mein de do" works.
Good Opening Bid: ₹60-80/kg. Vendor settles at ₹80-100.
Seasonal Note: Indian apple season is July-November. Off-season = cold storage = less fresh, but discounted.

[Item: Guava (Amrood)]
Wholesale Price: ₹25-35/kg (mandi rate)
Fair Retail Price: ₹40-60/kg (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹80-120/kg (first quote at premium shops)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹30/kg
Quality Check: Light green to yellowish = ripe. Hard and dark green = raw. Fragrant sweet aroma = ready to eat. Should give slightly when pressed.
Bargaining Tip: Very seasonal. When in season (winter), prices are low and vendor will give good deals. "Bhaiya kuch meethe wale chun ke de do" (pick the sweet ones) is expected.
Good Opening Bid: ₹25-35/kg. Vendor settles at ₹35-50.
Seasonal Note: Best in winter (Oct-Feb). Cheapest in Nov-Dec. Summer guavas exist but quality is lower.
Cultural Note: Vendors often let you taste one before buying. If they refuse, quality may be suspect.

[Item: Pomegranate (Anaar)]
Wholesale Price: ₹80-100/kg
Fair Retail Price: ₹120-180/kg (local customer rate)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹200-350/kg (first quote)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹100/kg
Quality Check: Heavy for size = juicy. Skin should be firm, not dried. Tap it -- metallic sound = good seeds. Crack at the crown -- deep red seeds = sweet. Pink = sour.
Bargaining Tip: Pomegranates are premium fruit. Vendor won't drop much but bulk buying (3kg+) gets 10-15% off.
Good Opening Bid: ₹80-100/kg. Vendor settles at ₹100-150.
Seasonal Note: Best quality Oct-Feb. Available year-round but summer ones are inferior.

[Item: Capsicum / Bell Pepper (Shimla Mirch)]
Wholesale Price: ₹30-50/kg (green) / ₹80-120/kg (red/yellow)
Fair Retail Price: ₹60-80/kg (green) / ₹120-200/kg (red/yellow)
Tourist/Inflated Price: ₹100-150/kg (green) / ₹200-350/kg (colored)
Vendor Margin Floor: ₹50/kg (green) / ₹100/kg (colored)
Quality Check: Firm and glossy = fresh. Wrinkled or soft = old. Green is cheapest and most common. Red and yellow are sweeter but cost 2-3x more.

Good Opening Bid: ₹40-50/kg (green). Vendor settles at ₹50-70.

Bazaar Items — Prices, Quality, and Negotiation Tips

Silk Scarf: Wholesale ₹150, Fair Retail ₹300-400, Tourist Price ₹800-1200. Banarasi silk is the most famous variety. To test quality, hold the fabric to light — real silk has a natural sheen and slight irregularities. Synthetic silk feels plasticky and has a uniform shine. A good opening bid is ₹200-250. The vendor will settle around ₹350-450 for genuine silk.

Brass Keychain: Wholesale ₹20, Fair Retail ₹50-80, Tourist Price ₹150-200. Common souvenir, low margins. These are mass-produced and widely available, so there is little reason to pay above ₹80. The vendor has very low cost, so they can drop the price quickly. Good for practice bargaining because the stakes are low.

Spice Box (Masala Dabba): Wholesale ₹200, Fair Retail ₹400-500, Tourist Price ₹900-1200. Stainless steel, 7 compartments. Higher-quality versions have magnetic lids and heavier gauge steel. Check for sharp edges on cheaper versions. A good bid starts at ₹300 and settles around ₹400-500.

Leather Wallet: Wholesale ₹100, Fair Retail ₹250-350, Tourist Price ₹600-800. The biggest quality question is genuine leather versus PU (polyurethane) leather. Genuine leather has a distinctive smell and texture. PU leather is lighter and has a more uniform surface. Ask the vendor to burn a tiny edge — real leather chars, PU melts. Good opening bid is ₹150-200.

Pashmina Shawl: Wholesale ₹500, Fair Retail ₹1000-1500, Tourist Price ₹3000-5000. Many are fake — synthetic fabric sold as pashmina. Real pashmina comes from the Changthangi goat in Kashmir. The "ring test" is popular — a genuine pashmina can be pulled through a finger ring due to its fineness. Good opening bid is ₹800-1000 for genuine quality. Be very cautious — this is the most commonly counterfeited item.

Juttis (Traditional Leather Shoes): Wholesale ₹150, Fair Retail ₹300-500, Tourist Price ₹800-1500. Rajasthani juttis are the most iconic. Quality varies widely — check for even stitching and comfortable insoles. Embroidered juttis cost more. A fair price for good quality with embroidery is ₹400-600.

Bangles (Glass/Lac): Wholesale ₹10-30 per set, Fair Retail ₹50-100 per set, Tourist Price ₹200-300 per set. Hyderabadi lac bangles and Rajasthani glass bangles are the most popular. These are fragile and break easily, so handle with care. Buying multiple sets gives better per-set pricing. A set of 4-6 bangles should cost ₹50-100.

Miniature Paintings: Wholesale ₹200-500, Fair Retail ₹500-1000, Tourist Price ₹2000-4000. Rajasthani miniature paintings on silk or paper. Quality depends on detail level and materials used. Genuine mineral pigments last longer than chemical paints. Check for hand-painted vs printed reproductions by looking at brush strokes closely.

Incense Sticks (Agarbatti): Wholesale ₹30-50 per pack, Fair Retail ₹80-120 per pack, Tourist Price ₹200-300 per pack. Mysore sandalwood agarbatti is premium. Nag Champa is the most internationally famous brand. These are lightweight and easy to transport. A good gift item with low cost.

Copper Water Bottle: Wholesale ₹200, Fair Retail ₹400-600, Tourist Price ₹1000-1500. Ayurvedic tradition says drinking from copper vessels is healthy. Check for pure copper (should have a slight pinkish tone) versus copper-plated. Heavier bottles tend to be better quality. A fair price is ₹400-600.
